This project was part of my exploration into Tableau Public for personal and professional knowledge. It has solidified my understanding of elements on a dashboard and introduced me to Tableau Public basics. I am already using concepts that I have learned about dashboards at work, so this was a great project.

I analyzed the Massachusetts Education Dataset to find if building more schools in the area would lead to more high school students attending college.

### Here are my findings:
* **12 to 19** - Class size average leads to more students attending college.
* **üíµ VS üí∏üí∏üí∏** - The economically advantaged students were more likely to graduate and attend college.
* **10 Highschools** - Below are 10 high schools that would benefit from the smaller class size
    1. Springfield Public Day High School
    1. Whaling City Junior/Senior High School
    1. Springfield High School
    1. Full Circle High School
    1. Grate Egleston Community High School
    1. Fecteau-Leary Junior/Senior High School
    1. Brockton Champion High School
    1. High School Learning Center
    1. Boston Collaborative High School
    1. Salem Prep High School
* **4th Grade Math** - These are the top 3 districts that had 50% of their students pass 4th Grade Math.
    1. Community Day Charter Public School - R. Kingman Webster (District)
    1. Community Day Charter Public School - Prospect (District)
    1. Community Day Charter Public School - Gateway (District)

## Overall Thoughts on Tableau Public
It‚Äôs a powerful tool with a small learning curve, but nothing that can‚Äôt be googled and found in their documentation. I‚Äôm looking forward to how to connect a database to Tableau and am excited to work with more dashboards!

Below are some of the things that I learned during this project. If you enjoyed my dashboard or found my tips below helpful please give this article a like, share it, bookmark it for future use, or leave a comment. Thanks so much!<br><br>
